Project Gas Mileage:
Create a class called Automobile in which you pass a gas mileage
(miles per gallon) parameter to the constructor which in turn passes
it to the state variable, mpg. The constructor should also set the
state variable gallons(gas in tank) to 0. \

A method called fillUp adds gas to the tank.

Another method, takeTrip, removes gas from the tank as
the result of driving a specified number of miles.

The method reportFuel returns how much gas is left in the car.
